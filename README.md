# Where Love Lies Overhaul

## Goal
The main goal is to update the maps to match the current version of Rejuvenation (currently V13.5), while changing the text as little as possible, and to fix some bugs, mistakes and issues.

## Installation
1. Download & unpack [Where Love Lies](https://www.rebornevo.com/forums/topic/34082-version-1-where-love-lies/)
2. Copy the content of "Changed Files" into the same folder & allow the files to be overwritten
3. (Optional) Copy the content of "Rejuvenation Integration" into your Rejuvenation v13.5 folder & allow the files to be overwritten
4. Simply start the game

### Script

<details>
  <summary>Surfing Wall Glitch Fix</summary>
  
**Description:**  
When exiting surfing the player goes by two tiles into this direction resulting in the player possibly being placed out of bounds or in an impassible tile or event.

**Fix:**
```ruby
$lastpbEndSurfResult = false

alias follower_realEndSurf follow_pbEndSurf
def follow_pbEndSurf(xOffset,yOffset)
  return $lastpbEndSurfResult
end

alias follower_endSurf pbEndSurf
def pbEndSurf(xOffset,yOffset)
  $lastpbEndSurfResult = follower_realEndSurf(xOffset,yOffset)
  follower_endSurf(xOffset,yOffset)
  return $lastpbEndSurfResult
end
```

**Explanation of the Bug:**  
The move in class `Game_Player` was not canceled, because the file `"Follower.rb"` overwrote the method `pbEndSurf`, but does not return any value. Therefore the player was moved one tile by dismounting (in the form of a jump) and one tile by the default move action.

<details>
  <summary>Font Loading Fix</summary>
  
**Description:**  
When loading up the game it might pop up a message, that not all fonts are installed, even though they are.

**Fix:**
```ruby
module FontInstaller
  class <<self
    alias_method :old_install, :install
  end

  def self.install 
    # Check if all fonts already exist
    fontsExist=true
    dest=self.getFontFolder()
    for i in 0...Names.size
      if !Font.exist?(Names[i])
        fontsExist=false
      end
    end
    return if fontsExist
    # Else call install method
    old_install
  end
end
```

**Explanation of the Bug:**  
As far as I understand it was only checked if the files are in the directory and not if the font itself was installed. Seemingly the installed fonts have a different name, and therefore they are not found by this check. (Automatic Installation is still broken because writing the new file in copy_file fails)
